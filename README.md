Hi, Iâ€™m Vani Mardirossian, a mid-level software engineer currently working with Spring Boot. I'm simultaneously trying to deepen and widen my knowledge base in the following direction:
- Java ecosystem
- Spring Framework and Spring Boot
- DevOps tools, CI/CD pipeline creation and maintenance
- Networking basics
- Apache Kafka, Elastic Stack

I plan to document my progress on GitHub as I move along these topics, hoping to add to the list as new areas of interest come along.
